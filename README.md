# Welcome to My AES Cypher Encryption Implementation in Python!

This is a work in progress, so please bear with me as I continue to improve and expand upon it.

## Current Features
- Supports 128-bit keys
- Operates using ECB mode

## Future Plans
- Add support for 192-bit and 256-bit keys
- Implement support for CBC mode

## Using This Implementation
To use this implementation, refer to the test.py file for examples and instructions.

## Feedback and Suggestions
If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always looking for ways to improve and learn more about encryption.

Thank you for checking out my project!
