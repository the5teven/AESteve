# AESteve

Welcome to my implementation of AES cypher encryption in Python! This is a work in progress, so please bear with me as I continue to improve and expand upon it.

Currently, this implementation supports 128-bit keys and operates using ECB mode. I am working on adding support for 192-bit and 256-bit keys, as well as implementing support for CBC mode.

To use this implementation, refer to the test.py file for examples and instructions. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to let me know. I'm always looking for ways to improve and learn more about encryption. Thank you for checking out my project!
