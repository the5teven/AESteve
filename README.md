# AESteve

This is my implementation of  the AES cypher encryption in python. 
It is not the fastest implementation but it was fun to learn how to code the encryption that has been deemed the standard.

As of right know it only works with 128bit keys but soon it will have suport for 192bit and 256bit keys. 
Also only works with ECB but soon CBC will be implemented.

Please see test.py to see how to use.
